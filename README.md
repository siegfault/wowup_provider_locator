# wowup_provider_locator
Find replacements for WowUp's 'unknown' providers

Opens a google search for each addon with an 'Unknown' provider. This allows you to avoid going back and forth between `My Addons` and `Get Addons`. Find a reasonable link for each addon (from github or wowinterface), and use the `Install from URL` option on the `Get Addons` page.

Running provider_locator.vbs will pull up a file explorer. You will need to find addons.json (for me, it's at `C://Users/name/AppData/Roaming/WowUp/addons.json`).

Todo: Is there really no way to import these packages?
